# Mathe Aufgaben

This is a small school project that calculates different math problems. 

## Description

It comes with a GUI out of the box and a terminal interface is in the Source code. It is written in Java and the GUI is made with Swing and I used FlatLaf (Dark Theme) for a streamlined visual experience.
